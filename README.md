# Wordpress-Tailwind
A lightweight wordpress theme that uses tailwind.

See the theme live: [https://rafel.github.io/wordpress-tailwind/index.html](https://rafel.github.io/wordpress-tailwind/index.html).

Obviously the theme on the link is not running on Wordpress but the assets (html, javascript and css) is generated by the wordpress theme. The purpose of the link is to provide you a sample of the setup so you can inspect the assets.

# Getting started

    git clone git@github.com:rafel/wordpress-tailwind.git
    cd wordpress-tailwind/dev
    npm install

# During development
Run the watcher

    npm run watch


Always work on the **dev/style.css** and **dev/script.js** files inside the dev-folder.

Never work on the style.css and script.js in the root folder of theme, they will be overwritten automatically with the code from  **dev/style.css** and **dev/script.js**

# Build for production
Create a minified javascript file and a minified and purged css file for production.

    npm run build

You can now copy your theme to the production with minified assets. **Don't copy the dev folder or it's files to the server.**
